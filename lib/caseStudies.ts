        description: "This case simulates a realistic McKinsey-style consulting problem, challenging you to analyze market attractiveness, strategic fit, and entry strategies for a specialty coffee chain considering international expansion. Similar to McKinsey interviews, it requires a structured, MECE approach to decision-making, focusing on identifying key opportunities and potential risks.",
        cardContent: "A specialty coffee chain plans to expand internationally, targeting either Europe or Southeast Asia. Analyze both regions for market size, competition, and strategic fit. Recommend an optimal entry strategy (e.g., joint venture, franchising, or fully owned stores) and consider how to mitigate operational, cultural, and financial risks.",
        background: "A specialty coffee chain, currently successful in its domestic market, is considering expanding internationally. The chain prides itself on serving high-quality, ethically sourced coffee, and creating a unique customer experience centered around comfortable seating, high-speed internet, and premium customer service. The company currently operates 250 stores in its home market, which are highly profitable. The leadership is evaluating whether to expand into new international markets, with a particular focus on Europe or Southeast Asia. They need to determine which region offers the best opportunity for growth, and how they should approach the expansion.",
